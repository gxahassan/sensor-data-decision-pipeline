# sensor-data-decision-pipeline
Sensor Data Processing and Track management System is a C++ software architecture project used to simulate how safety-critical systems validate noisy input sensor data.

# Why?
I decided upon this project so that I could explore how robust software design, clear state management and traceable decision making is applied in aerospace-styled systems, while keeping the scope defined on software engineering aspects, rather than domain-specific physics.
